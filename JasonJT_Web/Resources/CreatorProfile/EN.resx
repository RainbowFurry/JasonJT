    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

            &lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;My Outing&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;

            &lt;p class="OutingContent"&gt;
                I came out to my mother on 6/29/2021, as they call it (at the age of 22yo). 
                I had been planning to tell her in some way for about 5 years, but I wanted to wait for the right time. 
                An idea, or let's say an approach how to tell her, I also did not have. 
                But since I had to admit to myself that the right time will never come, I decided to tell her, 
                to tell her when I'm done with my training. 
                On the 29th was my final oral exam, which I successfully passed. 
                On the way to my car, after the exam I was overjoyed and sad at the same time and I had to cry, 
                because I knew that I had reached my goal, which I had set for myself for 5 years. 
                These 5 years were a shitty time for me, but they also had nice moments every now and then. 
                times again beautiful moments to offer had. 
                My dream job, so now no one can take away from me, but unfortunately I was not taken over by the company 
                and the message that I will not be taken over came somewhat at short notice.
                I knew the next day, I have to say goodbye to many nice colleagues and at the same time I have for the time being no company where I can work. 
                no company where I can work. All this made me cry, but at the same time I wanted to have a small change in my life and not to have 
                and not to be in a bad mood every day. 
                I also didn't want to have to hide or keep something secret every day. 
                And my decision to tell her with my passed training was already long fixed. 
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Arrived at home and after I told her my results and everything, I sat down at my PC and tried to tell her my confession. 
                tried to write her my confession. This way had two reasons, one was that I just couldn't tell her. 
                Secondly, my mother and I have had a very close and good relationship since forever.
                We tell each other everything and have no secrets. 
                Whenever one of us had something very important to tell the other, it was always in writing.
                this was done in writing. Thus, this was another reason why I did it this way. 
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
   It took me a long time to put together a little to-do list of what I would like to write to her. 
                It took me a long time to find questions that a mother could ask herself after this news. 
                When I had roughly everything together, after a short nice introduction, I tried to make it clear to her in a gentle but direct way that I would like to write to her,
                but direct white to make clear that I just do not tick as she would like it and now times gay. 
                Since I could think that the question comes since when, since I stood nevertheless since then on girls, 
                I answered this question in advance. I told her that this is not quite true and when she asked me, 
                which girl I think is pretty or which girl I like..,
                I said a good-looking girl.
                Afterwards I added that I have found boys cute since the first grade and have rather looked after a boy than a girl. 
                than a girl, let alone have I ever brought a girl home.
                To the question why I tell her only now, I also gave an answer in advance. 
                I have written to her in my letter that I wanted to tell her already 
                and tried to tell her, but she often could have noticed it by my statements, remarks, comments,
                or by the songs I always listen to, but she doesn't like my music. 
                A main aspect, why I have not said it for a long time was, because I knew for me how I tick and what I want. 
                I never had a problem with it or anything, but I knew or know how my family thinks about it. 
                Even though my mother has had a friendship with a transsexual man for many years, 
                she accepts him, his ways, etc., but when we were alone and she had the conversation with me regarding this person, 
                I quickly realized that it was not going to be easy. The last few months before my outing, 
                have made this even clearer, but she already had a strong 
                a strong suspicion. I had to listen to questions and statements like: 
                Is this a gay hairstyle? Hopefully not a gay hairstyle. 
                Why are you wearing the jacket tied around your waist? 
                And much more... 
                But she also noticed it from my behavior/manner, 
                shaved legs or by one or the other order. 
                &lt;br /&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;
                Her reaction, after she had read the letter, was a WhatsApp message in which she told me, 
                that if I wanted to talk can come to her. At that moment, however, it was very uncomfortable for me and I 
                wanted to hear only music. After about another hour, I got another message from my mother,
                asking me to come to her, which I did. I sat down next to her and she took me directly into her arms.
                in her arms. After that it was quiet for a while and she cried.
                After a few more minutes of uncomfortable silence, she slowly started to ask me one or two questions.
                Normally I would talk to anyone about these questions without hesitation, even with my mother, but in this moment it was not so easy to talk to her.
                moment, it was not so easy, while I looked into her crying face. But I answered her every question
                and told her from the beginning that she can ask whatever she wants and she will get an answer.
                After that she felt a little better for the moment and I spent the rest of the evening with her.
                The next morning, I just felt incredibly comfortable! And every other day only got better and better.
                After about a week, my mom processed it as well and has not been sad ever since easily.
            &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Respect, (Nothing really)&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="info"&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;What am I tired of?&lt;/b&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Giving accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="info"&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;Who do I dislike?&lt;/b&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;All people who harm other people in any form, Me&lt;/p&gt;.
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="info"&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;What makes me sad?&lt;/b&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Pity of others, being alone, certain songs, Army soldiers coming home after years&lt;/p&gt;.
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="info"&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;What song would play at my funeral?&lt;/b&gt;
                &lt;br /&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="info"&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;What am I ashamed of?&lt;/b&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;weight&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="info"&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;What am I embarrassed about?&lt;/b&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Nothing, or I wouldn't be doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="Info"&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;What makes me uncomfortable?&lt;/b&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;There are many things...&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="info"&gt;
                &lt;b&gt;What do I not want to do?&lt;/b&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Hurting/disappointing/letting someone feel bad because of me.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
