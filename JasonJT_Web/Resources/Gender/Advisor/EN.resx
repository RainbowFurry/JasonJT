    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    &lt;h4&gt;How do I act when my friend comes out?&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        With friends to give an advice is a little more difficult, the I find there you do not need to give advice.
        To me, friends or colleagues have already said that they are gay.
        On it gave from me mostly as an answer, I have already thought. I always found the astonished look funny,
        but I did not tell the person that I am also gay.
        For many people who come out, many contacts break off from this point on, but why?
        The friendship or the behavior will still not change!
        On the contrary, a gay person is attached to friendships and he will always be there for you when you need him.
        I would also say that you can have a lot of fun with a gay friend (disco, partying, etc.).
        It might be weird because you might have the thought that your boyfriend might be into you,
        but well, if that's the case, then it was like that before and you can't change it.
        But I think that your friend knows how to behave and it remains a normal friendship.
        Maybe he will try to come out to you first and find help.
        Show him your understanding and that you are there for him, it is something normal and nothing bad, he has done nothing wrong!

    <value>&lt;h1&gt;Guide for parents and relatives&lt;/h1&gt;.

    &lt;h4&gt;How do I act when my child comes out?&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        When your child comes out, it comes as a shock to many parents at first!
        The worst reaction in this moment, is to get angry.
        Sure, it is not easy to process this news first,
        But it was also not easy for their child to give them this news.
        If it accidentally slipped out in the argument, it can be an even bigger shock for your child.
        shock.
        Show understanding and that you are ready to talk, if your child is as well.
        As soon as your child wants to talk to you, he will say everything by himself and if there are any questions, he will answer them,
        they will answer them if your child is ready.
        It should be casual, relaxed, open conversation and your child should feel comfortable, even if they are
        it can/will still be oppressive in the beginning.
        One question I can take away in advance is the question since when?
        The question is stupid in my eyes, because the answer is always. It is rather the question when one stands to it!
        A better question would be if you should tell the other relatives or if your child wants to do it himself.
        You should also notice a small difference in the next days and weeks.
        Your child will show them who he really is in a different way.
        This can be varhaltensmäßig, it can be clothing-related or other.
        This does not mean that your child is now a different person, on the contrary, he is still the old one, only
        your child now starts not to hide everything and behaves/do what your child always wanted.
        The joy will last, but the day will come when they will be happy with their child and for their child.

    <value>&lt;h1&gt;Guide before coming out&lt;/h1&gt;.

    &lt;h4&gt;What should I do? I'm at a loss&lt;/h4&gt;.

    &lt;p&gt;
        If you are sure what you want and where you want to go, then we already have
        the first step. My next question would be, are you hiding something at home from your
        from your parents that is related to this. If so, how does it feel to always have to hide it?
        to have to hide it? It could also be that there were conversations, like about
        a friend and you lied to that person. If that is the case, how did it
        or does it still feel like not telling anyone?
        I understand that it is not easy, if you read my profile, you know that
        I told my mother at the age of 22 and roughly what I told her.
        I told her. I had not told anyone before, it was only from that day on that everyone
        I knew about it. Since this is not so "easy" for everyone, it would be advisable,
        first of all to talk about it with his best friend. Should this also
        option for the beginning, then maybe a stranger would be a contact point.
        a contact point. Other people can help you bit by bit and accompany you on your way.
        accompany you on your way. I would be there for you at any time, should you need help.
        Otherwise, I can only recommend &lt;a href="https://qtcandor.com/"&gt;QT Candor&lt;/a&gt;.
        
        An open conversation/chat can not be easy in the beginning, I have been through all of that
        behind me, but it is a first step towards improvement.
        Finally, ask yourself if it's worth hiding all of this?
        Why are you hiding it? Are you harming yourself?
        I can only tell you that it is your life, your life in which only you decide what you want to do.
        what you want to do. Only you decide which way you go, what you wear etc..
        Everybody has his life and everybody lives his life. Everyone can try to change you
        whether you allow it depends on you, but why live a life according to the wishes or ideas of others?
        of others? Don't they live their own life according to their ideas?
        Start to find yourself and love yourself, then start to stand up for who you are and fight for what you want.
        fight for what you want, or you will never get it and live a "lie".
        I can only tell you that no matter what you do, your parents will be there for you.
        (With friends it is a bit more difficult, but then you will see who your real friends are and you will find
        you will see that you will find new real friends very quickly).
